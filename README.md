This is repository of code that I collect when learnning to use Theano.

Most of the codes are directly from [Theano tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html) and [Lasagne tutorial]
(http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/tutorial.html)

GoogleLenet.py is the script to train the 4 inception module network that I demonstrate in class. It should work in both python2 and python3.
